# Prometheus exporter for Citrix NetScaler
This exporter collects statistics from Citrix NetScaler and makes them available for Prometheus to pull.  As the NetScaler is an appliance it's not recommended to run the exporter directly on it, so it will need to run elsewhere.

## NetScaler configuration
The exporter works via a local NetScaler user account.  It would be preferable to configure a specific user for this which only has permissions to retrieve stats and specific configuration details.

If you lean towards the NetScaler CLI, you want to do something like the following (obviously changing the username as you see fit).

````
# Create a new Command Policy which is only allowed to run the stat command
add system cmdPolicy stat ALLOW (^stat.*|show ns license|show serviceGroup)

# Create a new user.  Disabling externalAuth is important as if it is enabled a user created in AD (or other external source) with the same name could login
add system user stats "password" -externalAuth DISABLED # Change the password to reflect whatever complex password you want

# Bind the local user account to the new Command Policy
bind system user stats stat 100
````

## Usage
You can monitor multiple NetScaler instances by passing in the URL, username, and password as command line flags to the exporter.  If you're running multiple exporters on the same server, you'll also need to change the port that the exporter binds to.

| Flag        | Description                                                                                               | Default Value |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| username    | Username with which to connect to the NetScaler API                                                       | none          |
| password    | Password with which to connect to the NetScaler API                                                       | none          |
| bind_port   | Port to bind the exporter endpoint to                                                                     | 9280          |
| debug       | Enable debug logging                                                                                      | false         |

Run the exporter manually using the following command:

````
Citrix-NetScaler-Exporter.exe --username stats --password "my really strong password"
````

This will run the exporter using the default bind port.  If you need to change the port, append the `-bind_port` flag to the command.

Browse to http://localhost:9280/target=https://netscaler.domain.tld where `https://netscaler.domain.tld` is the URL of the NetScaler to get metrics from.

You can also specify the `ignore-cert=yes` querystring parameter in order to skip the certificate check.  This option should be used sparingly, and only when you fully trust the endpoint.

### Prometheus Configuration

The exporter needs to be passed the address of the NetScaler to get metrics from as a parameter, this can be done with relabelling.

Example config:
```YAML
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'netscaler'
    metrics_path: /netscaler
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - 'https://netscaler.domain.tld'
        - 'https://netscaler-2.domain.tld'
    params:
      ignore-cert: ["yes"] # Generally this option should not be used.  Only use it if you truly trust the endpoint and know it is secure.  You may need a different job block for where you want to ignore certs.
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9280  # The exporter's real hostname:port.
```

### Running as a service
Ideally you'll run the exporter as a service.  There are many ways to do that, so it's really up to you.  If you're running it on Windows I would recommend [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/).

## Building the executable
All dependencies are version controlled, so building the project is really easy.

1. `git clone https://github.com/mckesson/mk-citrix-exporter.git`.
2. From within the repository directory run `make`.
3. Hey presto, you have an executable.
